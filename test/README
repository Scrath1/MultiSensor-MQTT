This directory is intended for PlatformIO Test Runner and project tests.

Unit Testing is a software testing method by which individual units of
source code, sets of one or more MCU program modules together with associated
control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to
determine whether they are fit for use. Unit testing finds problems early
in the development cycle.

Tests are grouped by the target on which they can be run.
- `test_common`: Tests which can be executed on both the MCU and the local machine
- `test_embedded`: Tests which require the MCU to function due to specific HW requirements.
- `test_nativeOnly`: Tests which can only be run on the desktop.
  Their purpose is to verify functionality which can be used for debugging on a desktop machine.
